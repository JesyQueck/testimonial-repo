                <h1>I recieved a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learnt were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth. </h1>
                <p>"I was am EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transistion and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. 
                    I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.
                    Since completing this course, I've successfully switched career, working as a software engineering in a VR startup. "</p>

                <p>"I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. Inow work as a mobile engineer for a big company. This is one of the best investment I've made in myself. "</p>

                    <h1>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidiance from them and learning from their experience was easy.</h1>
                    <p>"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out
                        to the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. "</p>

                    <h1>Such a life changing experience. Highly recommended!. </h1>
                    <p>" Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed structure  from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs 
                        who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curricullum and staff did not disappoint They were hands-on and I never had to wait for a long assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was 
                        outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever. In fact, I've almost referred to it during interview as an example of my develpoment experience it certainly helped me land a job as 
                        a full-stack developer after recieving multiple offer. 100% recommended!. "</p>
